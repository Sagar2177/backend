### For normal package transfer in APIs, TCP/IP is used i.e., for transporting data.
### For live video streaming and voice calls RTP, RTMP, RTSP and private video protocol are used.
### For web access http/https is used.
### For email SMTP, POP and IMAP are used

## Types of APIs other than REST are:

2. JSON RPC and XML RPC

## If a website is using REST API, its data will always be in JSON format.
